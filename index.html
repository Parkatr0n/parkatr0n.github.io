        <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This is currently a testing website, but in the future I'll be
            updating this site with progress on certain projects and more. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

        <h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>
        <p>Yikes. Not much at the moment, I've dedicated myself to nothing until
            the 2018 summer starts. In the meantime, I've been focusing on
            schoolwork and side projects here and there.</p>
        <p>While it is extremely bland, and equally embarassing at the moment,
            you can check out <a href="https://github.com/Parkatr0n" style="text-decoration: underline;">my github profile</a>,
            which lists my repositories. Definitely not impressive right now.</p>

        <h3>What's your favorite language?</h3>
        <p>C for the win, baby!</p>
        <p>My favorite languages changes a lot, as I switch between some depending
            on the current project.</p>
